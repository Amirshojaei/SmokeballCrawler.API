# SmokeballCrawler

# Project Overview

This solution is developed using **.NET 8** and features **Swagger** for API documentation and testing. 

## Architecture

The project adheres to a **Clean Architecture** design and implements the **CQRS** pattern.

## Configuration

The solution runs on **port 7012**. To change the port, please refer to the `launchSettings.json` file.
Please remeber that if you change this port, you need to change the corresponding port number in client applications. Please refer to readme in client applicaions.
## Testing the API

You can test the API directly using **Swagger**. Once the solution is running, the Swagger UI will open automatically, providing an intuitive interface to explore and interact with the API endpoints.

## Future Enhancements

If time allowed, I would design the solution to facilitate integration of various search engines with minimal effort. Additionally, I would delve deeper into specific tests.
